gm gm gm!!!

*Indexing Blockchain Data is really really hard* and indexing transactions of something like [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) is a lethal task. But [**The Graph Protocol**](https://thegraph.com/) greatly reduces the complexity of this.

We will be learning how to build, deploy, and play with Subgraph for a simple Token Swapping Contract.

The following are the prerequisites for this tutorial:

* Basic Solidity and GraphQL understanding.
    
* [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)
    
* [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
    
* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

# Building the Token Swap Contract

This is the Token Swap Contract we will be using for our example.

%[https://gist.github.com/megabyte0x/2877d16843008371ff19cc93a3ac778d] 

The following are the main functions we will be focusing on in our subgraph:

* `addLiquidity(uint256 _tokenAmount)`: This adds liquidity to the pool and emits `GraphKitExchange__LiquidityAdded` event.
    
* `removeLiquidity(uint256 _amount)`: This removes liquidity from the pool and emits `GraphKitExchange__LiquidityRemoved` event.
    
* `ethToTokenSwap(uint256 _minTokens)`: This swaps ETH to the Token and emits `GraphKitExchange__ETHToTokenSwap` event.
    
* `tokenToETHSwap(uint256 tokenSold, uint256 minTokens)`: This swaps Token to ETH and emits `GraphKitExchange__TokenToETHSwap` event.
    

Having these above events is important as the Graph Nodes will be listening to these events and storing the data (defined in schema) as it gets emitted.

This is the Basic ERC20 Contract we will be using:

# Deploy the Contracts

Now deploy these contracts using Remix on Polygon Munbai Testnet.

<div data-node-type="callout">
<div data-node-type="callout-emoji">‚ö†</div>
<div data-node-type="callout-text">Make sure to deploy <code>Token.sol</code> first and then use that contract address and deploy <code>GraphKitExchange.sol</code></div>
</div>

Head to your [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) and follow the steps:

1. Connect with the Injected Provider and select Polygon Mumbai Testnet as the network.
    
2. Get some **TEST MATIC** on Mumbai Testnet from the Faucet, [here](https://faucet.polygon.technology/).
    
3. Deploy `Token.sol`
    
    1. Copy the above contract and paste it into the Remix file.
        
    2. Then select the contract and enter the constructor parameters. I have entered `MEGABYTE`,`MB` and `100000000000000000000`
        
    3. Hit Transact.

7. Verify the contracts on the [Mumbai Scan](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/)
    
    > Learn how to do it [here](https://www.quicknode.com/guides/ethereum-development/smart-contracts/different-ways-to-verify-smart-contract-code#method-3-verify-via-remixide--etherscan-plug-in).
    
8. Keep both the contract addresses handy, we will be using them shortly.

## Create a subgraph on Subgraph Studio

1. Head to [https://thegraph.com/studio](https://thegraph.com/studio)
    
2. Create Subgraph on Polygon Mumbai Testnet
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1693137682942/bbf55fac-e7f6-410b-a582-0d985eb926a7.png align="center")

1. Keep the **Subgraph Slug** and **Deploy Key** handy.
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1693138083744/3a972c77-9ccf-46bb-b692-0bf9e459e9fd.png align="center")

## Install the Graph Protocol CLI

You need to install `graph-cli` to use the Subgraph Studio from your system.

Follow the steps for installing it:

1. Open up your terminal.
    
2. Paste the following command and hit ENTER:
    
    ```bash
    yarn global add @graphprotocol/graph-cli
    ```
    

## Initialize your Subgraph‚Å†

It's time to start working on your Subgraph:

1. Create a new directory.
    
    `mkdir tokenSwapSubgraph`
    
2. Initialize the subgraph \[Paste your subgraph slug\]
    
    `graph init --studio <SUBGRAPH_SLUG>`
    
3. Choose `ethereum` as the protocol
    
4. Enter the subgraph slug name
    
5. Name the directory.
    
6. Select `mumbai` as the Ethereum Network
    
7. Enter the Contract Address for `GraphKitExchange.sol` contract.
    
8. Use the default start block.
    
9. Enter the name of the contract, here is `GraphKitExchange`
    
10. Select `true` for **the index contract event as entities**
    
11. Type `y` for entering a new contract address (for `Token.sol`)
    
12. Type `n` for providing local ABI path.
    
13. Enter the name of the contract, here is `Token`
    

Here's how it will look in your terminal üëáüèª

    In the `src` directory you will see that it auto-generated the mappings for your subgraph as per the events in your contracts.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1693143672187/e5cc4fa5-885f-4423-9138-b162c34c1d2c.png align="center")
    

> Your Subgraph is ready now. It's time to deploy it.

## Deploy the Subgraph

We are almost done! Let's deploy our subgraph.

1. Authenticate your Graph Studio Key \[Get Deploy Key from your subgraph studio\]
    
    ```bash
    graph auth --studio <DEPLOY KEY>
    ```
    
2. Deploy your subgraph with your `subgraph slug`
    
    ```bash
    graph deploy --studio graphkitexchange
    ```
    
3. Enter the `v0.0.1` as the version for your subgraph
    
4. In the end, you will see this üëáüèª
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1693143955284/5daa5f9a-a7b1-41bb-a756-4a0abf24ceac.png align="center")
    
    Here you got the <mark>subgraph endpoint, </mark> [https://api.studio.thegraph.com/query/48418/graphkitexchange/v0.0.1](https://api.studio.thegraph.com/query/48418/graphkitexchange/v0.0.1)
    

> Whoo!!! That's a lot of work! But congrats ü§© You deployed your subgraph for a Token Swapping Contract.

# Play with the Subgraph using Subgraph Studio

So, it's time to use a decentralized, most effective and inexpensive way of querying the blockchain data.

I'll be using a Subgraph Playground for the same. \[Not a frontend dev... hehe\]

## Creating Txn on the contracts

Before using the subgraph we need to create some transactions so we can query them.

Follow the steps to approve `GraphKitExchange`'s contract address on `Token` Contract.

1. Open your `Token.sol` contract on Mumbai Scan, and head towards the `Contract` Tab. [*Here's mine.*](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0xB2887fA56b2601cB5877A99188c3f23731F671F5#code)
    
2. Click on the `Write` tab below `Contract` tab. *Since you have already verified the contract, you will be able to Write transactions on it using the Etherscan UI.*
    
3. Connect your Metamask with the Etherscan by clicking on `Connect to Web3`
    
4. Now head to the `approve` function and open the modal.
    
5. Enter the address of the `GraphKitExchange` contract address and the amount in `wei`
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1693510431413/53f78846-0f4d-4489-b0ea-130d57be35ea.png align="center")
    
6. Click on `Write` and confirm the transaction.
    

<div data-node-type="callout">
<div data-node-type="callout-emoji">üòÄ</div>
<div data-node-type="callout-text">Since we have approved <strong>5 MB </strong>to <strong>GraphKitExchange Contract</strong> it's time to add some Liquidity into the contract.</div>
</div>

Follow these steps to create your first transaction on the `GraphKitExchange` Contract:

1. Open your `GraphKitExchange.sol` contract on Mumbai Scan, and head towards the `Contract` Tab. [*Here's mine.*](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0xd8F178e60F3A7434F0F4E2519e6C2B89575f8123#code)
    
2. Click on the `Write` tab below `Contract` tab. *Since you have already verified the contract, you will be able to Write transactions on it using the Etherscan UI.*
    
3. Connect your Metamask with the Etherscan by clicking on `Connect to Web3`
    
4. Click on `addLiquidity` and enter the 5 Matic and 5 MB (in wei) into the respective fields.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1693510952482/66c8aba4-0104-42fd-9fc9-797b4d8ae11f.png align="center")
    
5. Click on `Write` and confirm the transaction.
    
6. You will see a `View Transaction` button, click on it and copy the `transaction hash`
    

> Voila! We are good to go with our subgraph.

## Querying the Subgraph

Now we have a transaction ready in your GraphKitExchange Contract waiting to be queried by us.

Let's do this, by following these steps:

1. Head to your deployed Subgraph and select the playground. Mine is [https://thegraph.com/studio/subgraph/graphkitexchange/playground](https://thegraph.com/studio/subgraph/graphkitexchange/playground)
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1693509839817/5d64bd1f-2b70-45ba-9e24-f540da489a88.png align="center")
    
2. Now paste this into the query
    
    ```graphql
    query MyQuery {
      graphKitExchangeLiquidityAddeds 
    (where: {transactionHash: "Your Transaction Hash"}){
        _ethAmount
        _lpAmount
        _tokenAmount
        _user
      }
    }
    ```
    
    <div data-node-type="callout">
    <div data-node-type="callout-emoji">üí¢</div>
    <div data-node-type="callout-text">In "Your Transaction Hash" be sensible and paste your transaction hash üòÇ</div>
    </div>
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1693511663832/f72e3998-0962-41e8-b148-7585a9f752fa.png align="center")
    
3. Now click on that **YOUTUBE PLAY BUTTON**
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1693511706315/8847b6bb-f25b-42a3-979f-cf27dfa6c18b.png align="center")
    
    As you can see on the right side we got this üëáüèª
    
    ```json
    {
      "data": {
        "graphKitExchangeLiquidityAddeds": 
          [{
            "_ethAmount": "5000000000000000000",
            "_lpAmount": "5000000000000000000",
            "_tokenAmount": "5000000000000000000",
            "_user": "0x1cb30cb181d7854f91c2410bd037e6f42130e860"
          }]
        }
    }
    ```
    
    It has the same data we emitted in our `GraphKitExchange__LiquidityAdded` but we didn't require to have the node setup or to some centralised node provided for this query.
    
    Querying with The Graph Protocol is superfast, decentralized and inexpensive.
    
4. TASK: Use the rest of the functions and query the subgraph for the events they emit.
